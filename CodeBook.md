### Samsung measurement summary data
Samsung measurement summary data set contains 20 variables and 180 observations.
Each observation represents mean and standard deviation of measured variables for each subject 
and each activity.

### Variable Description
 * subject: col1, ID of the subject who performed the activities. Range is from 1 to 30
 
 * activities: col2, Label of 1 of 6 activities performed by the subjects
 
 * tBodyAccmeanX, Y, Z: col3-5, mean of X, Y, Z body acceleration from the accelerometer
        
 * tBodyAccstdX, Y, Z: col6-8, standard deviation of X, Y, Z body acceleration from the accelerometer
 
 * tGravityAccmeanX, Y, Z: col9-11, mean of X, Y, Z gravity acceleration from the accelerometer
